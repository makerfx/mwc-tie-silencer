This is the repo for the Magic Wheelchair Kylo Ren Tie Silencer build for Stryder

Interactive Elements built by Ian Whitehouse, prototyping and code by Ian Cole.

Interactive elements include:

4 illuminated arcade buttons that activate light & sound
  - Photo Torpedo
  - Laser Cannon (turns off background music if you hold the button)
  - Kylo Ren speech (and an easter egg if you hold the button!)
  - Engine Boost (decreases background engine sound level if you hold the button)
  
Sound files and animation files are stored on the microsd card.
  
Weapons LEDs - 20 addressable LEDs per side, in lightsaber tubing. Used for Laser & Photon Torpedo animations

Main Engines - 290 addressable LEDs, animated by peak analysis on the engine audio channel
