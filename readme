This is the repo for the Magic Wheelchair Kylo Ren Tie Silencer build for Stryder

Interactive Elements built by Ian Whitehouse, prototyping and code by Ian Cole.

Interactive elements include:

4 illuminated arcade buttons that activate light & sound
  - Photo Torpedo
  - Laser Cannon (turns off background music if you hold the button)
  - Kylo Ren speech (and an easter egg if you hold the button!)
  - Engine Boost (decreases background engine sound level if you hold the button)
  
Sound files and animation files are stored on the microsd card.
  
Weapons LEDs
  20 addressable LEDs per side, in lightsaber tubing. 
  Used for Laser & Photon Torpedo animations which are stored on the SD card as BMP files.
    Each line of the BMP files is one frame of LED animation
    BMP files are stored in the repo
  Note that 20 LEDs were used per side and shared a data pin.

Main Engines
  290 addressable LEDs
  Animated by peak analysis on the engine audio channel
  Note that 145 LEDs were used per side and shared a data pin
